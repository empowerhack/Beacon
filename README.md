# Familyr (Team Beacon)

Familyr aims to help separated refugee families reunite with their loved ones and be re-assured that someone knows where they are.

Many refugee families only possess one mobile phone, which the husband is usually in control of. During the confusion of crossing borders and other chaotic situations they can be separated, with no way of contacting each other. Familyr would supply each family member with a ultra low-budget device, which - at the push a button - notifies the family phone with the member's location. 

This is a simple prototype to show the potential of the Familyr project.
